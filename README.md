The proposed project title under UCR is “52.5 MW BUNDLED SMALL HYDRO POWER
PROJECT BY ATIAIA”, which are 3 Hydro Power projects located in the cities of Chapadão do Sul,
state of Mato Grosso do Sul and Ribeirão, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The projects are operational
activities with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon
Registry” (UCR). These are run of the river projects:

_______________
SHP Areado:

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 2 Horizontal Axis Kaplan S Turbines, having individual nominal capacity of 9 MW. The
Project is connected to the city of Chapadão do Sul and supplies 18 MW of power to the national grid
“SIN” (Sistema Interligado Nacional) through the local grid.

The SHP received environmental licensing approval in September 2019. The powerplant was
commissioned in October 2019, when the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), issued the
Commercial License.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 100,000 MWh of electricity per
annum and supply it to the national grid. The renewable power generated by the project activity would
be displacing equivalent amount of grid electricity which has a relevant contribution of fossil-fuel
based power plants, resulting in an estimated emission reduction of 35,929.17 tCO2 per annum.

Since the project activity generates electricity through a run-of-river hydroelectric, a clean renewable
energy source, it does not cause any significant negative impact on the environment and thereby
contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.

SHP Bandeirante:

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 3 Horizontal Axis Kaplan S Turbines, having individual nominal capacity of 9.604 MW.
The Project is connected to the cities of Chapadão do Sul and Água Clara, supplying 28 MW of power
to the national grid “SIN” (Sistema Interligado Nacional) through the local grid.
The SHP received environmental licensing approval in July 2019. The powerplant was commissioned
in 2 phases on October 11th and 18th, 2019, when the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL),
issued the Commercial License.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 174,000 MWh of electricity per
annum and supply it to the national grid. The renewable power generated by the project activity would
be displacing equivalent amount of grid electricity which has a relevant contribution of fossil-fuel
based power plants, resulting in an estimated emission reduction of 62,516.76 tCO2 per annum.

Since the project activity generates electricity through a run-of-river hydroelectric, a clean renewable
energy source, it does not cause any significant negative impact on the environment and thereby
contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.

SHP Pedra Furada:

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 2 Horizontal Axis Francis Turbines, having individual nominal capacity of 3.43 MW.
The Project is connected to the city of Ribeirão and supplies 6,5 MW of power to the national grid
“SIN” (Sistema Interligado Nacional) through the local grid.

The SHP received its first environmental license in August 2011, which is currently renewed until
March 2026. The powerplant was commissioned in March 2012, when the National Electric Energy
Agency (ANEEL), issued the Commercial License.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 28,000 MWh of electricity per
annum and supply it to the national grid. The renewable power generated by the project activity would
be displacing equivalent amount of grid electricity which has a relevant contribution of fossil-fuel
based power plants, resulting in an estimated emission reduction of 10,060.17 tCO2 per annum.
Since the project activity generates electricity through a run-of-river hydroelectric, a clean renewable
energy source, it does not cause any significant negative impact on the environment and thereby
contributes to climate change mitigation efforts. 
____________
Total amount of emission reductions was 310,955 tCO2eq for the monitoring period, already
considering the deduction of MWh that were converted into I-RECs.
____________
Prior History

The SHP Bandeirante, part of this project, issued I-RECs from January/2022 to December/2022
